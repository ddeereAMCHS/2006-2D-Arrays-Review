# 2D Arrays Review

## Due: Fri 9/9 at 11:59 PM

- Create a program called `Arrays2DReview.java`
- Prompt the user for a filename
  - The first line will be the number of players on the team
  - The second line will be the number of statistics for each player
  - The rest of the file will be the data
- Read the data into a 2D array
- Calculate how many points each player scored
  - Normal shots are worth two points, free throws are worth one point
- Calculate how many points the team scored as a whole
- Calculate each player's free throw percentage (rounded to one decimal place)
